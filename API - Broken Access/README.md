# API – Broken Access Control (IDOR)

## 🧩 Challenge Information

- Platform: Root-Me  
- Category: Web / API  
- Challenge Name: API – Broken Access  
- Vulnerability Type: Broken Access Control / IDOR  
- Interface: Swagger-based API  

---

## 🎯 Goal

The goal of this challenge is to identify access control weaknesses in an API-based application that allow an authenticated user to access resources belonging to other users.

---

## 🧠 Application Overview

The application exposes a Swagger interface that allows interaction with several API endpoints.

Available endpoints:

- `POST /api/signup` – Register a new user  
- `POST /api/login` – Authenticate a user  
- `POST /api/note` – Create a note  
- `GET /api/user` – Retrieve user information  

Authentication is required to access user-related functionality, but authorization mechanisms are not clearly defined.

---

## 🔍 Initial Analysis

A new user account named `dalli` was created using the `/api/signup` endpoint and authenticated via `/api/login`.

After authentication, the `/api/user` endpoint became accessible.  
This endpoint includes a `user_id` input field in the Swagger interface.

However, changing the value of `user_id` did not affect the response.
The API always returned information related to the currently authenticated user.

Example response:

```json
{
  "note": "",
  "userid": 2,
  "username": "dalli"
}
```


## 🧪 Testing Attempts

### Attempt 1: Manipulating HTTP Method

The HTTP method was changed from `GET` to `POST`, and a different user ID was sent in the request body.

**Result:**
- Server responded with `405 Method Not Allowed`
- No change in returned data

This indicates that the endpoint strictly enforces the HTTP method, and user data cannot be accessed via request body manipulation.

---

### Attempt 2: Path-Based Object Reference

Instead of modifying parameters, the URL path itself was modified to include a different user ID:

```http
GET /api/user/1
```
**Response:**
```json
{
  "note": "RM{E4sy_1d0r_0n_API}",
  "userid": 1,
  "username": "admin"
}
```

- 'RM{E4sy_1d0r_0n_API}' -this is FLAG
